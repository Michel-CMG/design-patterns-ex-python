### Python Design Patterns Exercises

This is a small exercise project from a python design pattern book.

But the purpose is just for everyday contribution. Maybe commit nothing but some words (even not code) for everyday habit building.<br>
This idea is from Stephen Guise's book **Mini Habits**. Recommend to search the idea or just read the book.
